Presented by Extra Hop. Didn't catch the presenters name properly.

- Wishing for the best probably won't work.
- Products alone don't solve our problems.
- Incidents are inevitable.
- It's a "Cost of doing business" now.
- You don't control the situaton but you do control your response.
- Sometimes mistakes are made - is this an incident? 
- Preparation has a formula. 
- Five Core Components: 
	- 1. Program
		- You need a program. Choose a FRAMEWORK like NIST CSF. Framework and Strategy == Program. 
		- Program includes things like budgets, staff, and resources. Resources include Time and Technology. 
		- Response is a CAPABILITY. Respond within your means. 
		- Align your resources. 97 applications on average supported by six employees is NOT aligned. 
		- Internal -> External -> Law Enforcement -> Legal/Insurance/PR. 
			- Know the people!
		- Know your contraints!
	- 2. Policy
		- Policy is the explicit delcaration of your rules. 
			- What you must do.
			- What you CANNOT do.
			- Definition of duties. 
			- Regulatory and legal issues.
			- Concise and unambiguous. 
			- Will you pay a ransom? Sometimes or never? 
			- Remediate or replace? These aren't the same.
				- Who has accountability for this? 
			- When and How to report? 
		- Policy is a LEGAL framework.
	- 3. Plan
		- The value of a plan is in the ability to execute. 
		- Plans are tricky. Easy to overcomplicate. Try and keep it simple.
		- Don't write a book. Make it simple and one page. 
		- Make it comprehensive and flexible and accessible. 
			- PRINT
		- Review on a regular basis. At least annually. 
		- Reference ROLES and not PEOPLE. 
	- 4. People
		- It's easy to forget about the people.
		- Who are you gonna call? 
		- These are delicate situations.
		- Once the word is out it's out for good. Limit the spread of information. 
		- Who is the first call? Call tree? 
		- Who can make ACTUAL decisions? 
		- Can you contain or mitigate. They are not the same.
		- People have to communicate still.
		- Maintain confidentiality.
		- Name vs Role. Use Roles. Don't turn it into Brent from Phoenix Project.
		- Chain of command -> Could become life or death.
		- Approved IR vendors and contracts. Have them ahead of time if possible. Not time to negotiate! 
		- What about outside counsel? Insurance? 3rd parties? What about notifications to your employees? 
	- 5. Practice
		- Test and reflect. Don't get too overconfident. 
		- Things likely won't go according to plan. No plan survives contact w/ the enemy.
		- Defense in Depth NOT Spending in Depth. 
		- Plan A - F'ish. 
		- Learn from Formula 1 teams. Sub 4 second tire change.
		- Practice for real life IN real life. 
		- Practice non-ideal situations. 

Good presentation. Fantastic points made.
