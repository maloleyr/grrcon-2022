# EHLO is that You

Catherine Ullman @investigatorchi

- Email is the main gateway for attacks still.
- Burning question: Is this email legitimate? 
- Open relay problem getting better - domestically. 
- Envelope vs Header: 
	- Envelope
		- Thrown away by SMTP
		- Not visible
		- Easy to forge
	- Header
		- Inside the message
		- Written by mail transport services
		- Harder to forge but still possible
- Email "FROM" can be Anything. Zero validation.
- Read headers from bottom to top.
- Report everytime please. 
- TOOLS: 
	- Domain Dossier
	- MX Toolbox
	- Cyber Chef
- I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think that have ended up where I needed to be.
