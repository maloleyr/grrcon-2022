# Adversaries Rising

Dave Kennedy - Trusted Sec

- He is not an Iranian Nuclear Treaty expert. LOL
- 10 -- 15 years later things have changed. 
- @mrd0x
- Ransomware is becoming a full industry in and of itself.
- Security programs take time by design. Attackers don't have the same restrictions. 
- Positive progress on sharing between RED and BLUE. 
- Research is important. Must know/understand your adversary. 
- Security is expensive. 
- LAPSUS$ - Teenagers run amok. Yet they found vulnerabilities in the cloud apps/config and the application layer.
- Push MFA spam is BAD. 93% success rate from the first push.
	- SIDENOTE: I called this out over a year ago. I am now vindicated.
- Success giving targets a "heads up" ahead of the op in the form of "maintenance." 
- Groups are focusing on their niches allowing larger organizations to build comprehensive solutions for attack. Put's organized crime at the same level as a nation-state. 
- Large groups are run like any other business.
- We must focus on removing the monetary gain to disrupt these groups.
- Initial compromise easier to detect/block than detecting a long-term compromised environment.
- EDR == AV of 2022. Write your own detection scripts in this space. You can't just wait for the definitions to update. 
- Something about a "Magic Unicorn Tool" which is software Dave and Co developed.

- Working on an exploit: LastPass keeps vault in memory even after logout. Need to know if it survives a reboot.
- If you don't have a BASELINE then you cannot hunt.
	- This was brought up in several talks so this is an important one. 
- Telemetry is critical.
- Detection / Containment / Response can be fast and it must be. Focus energy and dollars here. 
- Deception within the network with the use of canaries is keen and it works. 
- Baseline + Monitoring is the way to go.
